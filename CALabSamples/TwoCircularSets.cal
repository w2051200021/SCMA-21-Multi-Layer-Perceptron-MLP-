This is a simple input file with two dimensional inputs and outputs.
There are two two-dimensional data sets centered at (x,y)= (5,5) and (-5,-5) respectively.
The data are located around the centers within a maximum radius of 4.0
It is designed for your code testing. 
You can start setting up a simple NN to verify your code.
The simplest NN should have only one hidden layer with only one neuron for easier verification.
You should carry out hand calculation on the neuron values and epsilons propagated to verify your code.
Good Luck!
